                    <p>PlaceHolder offers an innovative, up to date system to manage yours or your organisations' events.
                    We believe that systems like this should work for you, not the other way around! We want to provide a service
                    that allows you to control your event, your way.</p>

                    <h3>You're In Control</h3>
                    <p>When we say youâ€™re in charge, we mean it. PlaceHolder Bookings allows you to control how you create
                        and market your event, and focuses on providing a service that allows you to get on with it, and
                        then forget about it. Unless you want to modify it, once your event has been created, you can just
                        sit back and relax while your attendees book their places. </p>
